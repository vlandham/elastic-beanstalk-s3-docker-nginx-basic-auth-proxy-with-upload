> secure a bucket behind basic authentication without thinking about infra

*This assumes you have an [AWS] account, associated credentials with access
to manage elastic beanstalk applications.*

### Setup
First, fork and clone this repo. Then, install the [Elastic Beanstalk CLI],
adding a `eb-cli` profile to your AWS credentials to `~/.aws/config` like so:
```
[profile eb-cli]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAIMZWLTOOSTF6JN4A
aws_secret_access_key = NszqaFD+YDZrrIKzlL7dI2F3z4bF9pZUetQsItln
```

Next, edit `nginx.conf` to reference the bucket you're trying to proxy and the bucket
where uploads should go.

```
set $upload_bucket 'my-bucket-name';
set $site_bucket 'my-bucket-name';
```

**NOTE** the two buckets variables can point to the same S3 bucket.

Next, set up your credentials file, `.htpasswd`. If you don't know how to
generate usernames and passwords, [use this website](http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/).

### Test Locally (optional)
If you have [Docker] installed, you can now test your application thusly:
```
docker build -t proxy .
docker run -p 8080:80 proxy
```

Browse to [http://localhost:8080]() and enter your credentials. _If you didn't
change them, the username and password will be **test**._

### Initialize a new Elastic Beanstalk Application:
It's time to put your Dockerized proxy on the internet!
Next, run `eb init my-application-name` and answer the prompts to create a new
application.

Here is a sample output:
```
~/code/elastic-beanstalk-s3-docker-nginx-basic-auth-proxy-with-upload
❯ eb init nginx-s3-proxy

Select a default region
1) us-east-1 : US East (N. Virginia)
2) us-west-1 : US West (N. California)
3) us-west-2 : US West (Oregon)
4) eu-west-1 : EU (Ireland)
5) eu-central-1 : EU (Frankfurt)
6) ap-south-1 : Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
7) ap-southeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Singapore)
8) ap-southeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Sydney)
9) ap-northeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
10) ap-northeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Seoul)
11) sa-east-1 : South America (Sao Paulo)
12) cn-north-1 : China (Beijing)
13) us-east-2 : US East (Ohio)
(default is 3): 1
Application nginx-s3-proxy has been created.

It appears you are using Docker. Is this correct?
(y/n): y

Select a platform version.
1) Docker 1.11.2
2) Docker 1.9.1
3) Docker 1.7.1
4) Docker 1.6.2
(default is 1): 1
Note:
 Elastic Beanstalk now supports AWS CodeCommit; a fully-managed source control service. To learn more, see Docs: https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/
Do you wish to continue with CodeCommit? (y/n) (default is n): n
Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
(y/n): n
```

### Create an environment to run your application
You may run several versions of this application for various purposes (for
example, serving different buckets for development or production).

Start by creating a dev environment using `eb create --single`.

*Note: specifying `--single` is important for this simplified workflow, it
prevents a load balancer from being used, which in turn makes generating a
ip-based bucket policy (discussed later in this document) very easy.*

Here is a sample output:
```
~/code/elastic-beanstalk-s3-docker-nginx-basic-auth-proxy-with-upload
❯ eb create --single
Enter Environment Name
(default is nginx-s3-proxy-dev):
Enter DNS CNAME prefix
(default is nginx-s3-proxy-dev):
Creating application version archive "app-b250-161206_053805".

### Interacting w/ Your Application
You can now visit your proxy by running `eb open`.

### Ensure Static Website Hosting is Enabled
For the proxy bucket to work correctly, it should Have "Enable website hosting" enabled in its S3 properties.

### Enabel CORS for Uploads
The upload bucket should have CORS enabled.
A utility is included in this repository to generate the correct policy.
Running `.cors.sh` will output a CORS configuration to apply to the bucket.

### Granting Upload Access to S3 Bucket (or read access to private buckets)
If your bucket is private, the easiest way to give your application access is
to apply a bucket policy that grants full access by IP. A utility is included
in this repository to generate the correct policy. Running `./policy.sh` will
output a bucket policy you can apply manually in S3.

This policy should be applied to both file upload and proxy buckets.


#### Allowing Uploads
If you have applied the bucket policy mentioned above, it is now possible to
upload files directly to your bucket via the proxy. To test this, run the
following:
```
curl -T path/to/file.ext http://username:password@host/uploads/file.ext
```

*The included nginx config only allows uploading to URIs that begin with
`~/uploads`*
